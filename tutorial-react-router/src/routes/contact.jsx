  // Hu: The return { contact } syntax is used to return an object containing the contact variable. This is a common pattern in JavaScript, particularly when you want to return multiple pieces of data from a function, or when you want to maintain a consistent return type (an object) for easier access and destructuring in the caller.
  //   return { contact, metadata };
  // used as 'loader as contactLoader' in main.jsx.
  // contactLoader parameter is `:contactId`.
}
// within main.jsx
// Note the :contactId URL segment. The colon (:) has special meaning, turning it into a "dynamic segment". Dynamic segments will match dynamic (changing) values in that position of the URL, like the contact ID. We call these values in the URL "URL Params", or just "params" for short.

// These params are passed to the loader with keys that match the dynamic segment. For example, our segment is named :contactId so the value will be passed as params.contactId.

            confirm("Please confirm you want to delete this record.") is a built-in JavaScript function that displays a modal dialog with a specified message and OK/Cancel buttons.

            If the user clicks "Cancel", confirm returns false.

            event.preventDefault() is a method that prevents the default action associated with the event.
